I am an R&D-oriented computer scientist, mathematician, and software engineer with broad experience.
<img src="/imgs/AvatarCartoon400x400.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="avatar">
I have particular interests in compilers, programming languages, and virtual machines; computer vision and machine
learning; and algorithm design and mathematical programming.

I earned a Bachelor of Science degree with a double major in mathematics and computer science from Southern Adventist
University. I loved mathematics so much that I decided to pursue a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Texas A&M University.

My career path reflects a diverse range of roles, from a mathematics professor to principle software engineer and data
scientist in various organizations. I have a strong inclination towards roles where I can solve challenging problems,
often at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, and bring about innovative solutions or advancements in
the field.
