I am in Baltimore to attend the [2014 Joint Mathematics Meetings](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/jmm), the largest gathering of mathematicians in the world involving the [American Mathematical Society](http://ams.org), the [Mathematics Association of America](http://maa.org), and many other professional societies related to the mathematics profession. There will be over 2500 talks given on topics ranging from the mathematics of pop-up books (#489) to the density of Henig efficient points in locally convex topological vector spaces (#2341) to rational numbers and the common core (#903). Thousands of mathematicians, teachers, and students will be rubbing elbows and talking shop. There will be a mathematical art gallery and film screenings. Last year there were even performances of a mathematical play! This will be my third time attending the Joint Meetings. The previous two times were a total blast.

I'll be blogging the conference as the week progresses.

If you are a math blogger or Google Plusser who will be at the Joint Meetings, join us for an informal meet-up on Friday. I will update this post when we figure out a date. [Hit me up on Google+](https://plus.google.com/+RobertJacobson/posts) if you have suggestions.

*UPDATE*
We are meeting by the message board at 11:30am on Thursday. Be there or be $[0,1]^2$!
