      <title>Bayes&#39; Theorem and the Deathly Hallows</title>

      <description>This article is an expanded version of the math part of an article I cowrote with marine biologist Dr. Andrew Rhyne about how many well-meaning public health professionals have misinterpreted the math behind test efficiency, Bayesâ€™ Theorem. This misinterpretation has lead to dangerous public policy positions. Anyone with a math allergy is invited to read that article instead.&#xA;I and Dr. Andrew Rhyne, marine biologist and my longtime collaborator in fighting wildlife crime, have spent a lot of time in the last several months working on how best to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in college communities like our own Roger Williams University.</description>

It depicts the great philosophers of ancient Greece, famously with Plato pointing up and Aristotle pointing down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/communities/100568607954673744130&#34;&gt;Mathematics Community on Google+&lt;/a&gt; had our second ever Hangout On Air last week. I was joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/+LuisGuzmanJr/posts&#34;&gt;Luis Guzman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/+JasonDavison/posts&#34;&gt;Jason Davison&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/+AmyRobinson/posts&#34;&gt;Amy Robinson&lt;/a&gt; in a conversation that ranged from fluid dynamics to applying the mathematics of networks to map our ideas to JPEG image compression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sneaky Continuous Functions</title>

Students should be warned that these methods, while perfectly legitimate and often quite useful, are really just fancy ways of &lt;em&gt;guessing&lt;/em&gt; the value of the limit, that is, the graphical and numerical methods do not supply us with mathematical certainty regarding the value of the limit. After all, what if your function is very sneaky and merely &lt;em&gt;looks like&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;rsquo;s approaching a value $L$ as $x$ approaches $c$ when in fact it ultimately approaches a different value $K$?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s over. Getting my internet fix in the hotel lobby at midnight, walking 18 miles a day through the convention center, sitting in uncomfortable chairs for hours, getting dinner in a local restaurant and realizing halfway through the meal that every single person dining there is also a mathematician, randomly bumping into an old friend or mentor or student&amp;ndash;it ended today at around lunchtime when I made the trek back to the hotel lobby one last time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love the exhibit hall. I love books, and the exhibit hall is full of some of my favorite kinds of books. I spend hours picking through the texts, flipping through their pages. The AMS sold me on a great book directed at undergraduates on Fourier analysis and an advanced text on Riemannian manifolds. In fact, &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/111299122922781685506/posts/jcXLNdoUcYc&#34;&gt;they managed to photograph me mid-purchase&lt;/a&gt;! I also learned they are selling &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/111299122922781685506/posts/Apf42MJvpGx&#34;&gt;their first ever children&amp;rsquo;s book this spring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The best part of the Joint Meetings is networking with like-minded people. I ran into many old friends and colleagues. Today (Thursday) several math bloggers and Google+&amp;lsquo;ers organized an impromptu meeting for lunch. I stuck a sign on the message board inviting other math bloggers to join us, and a cohort of tumblr bloggers discovered it and joined us. Such is the power of the JMM message board.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned about connections between musical rhythm and knot theory, abstract algebra and dance, a Navy ship from the mid 1800s called the U.S.S. Constellation, and some great undergraduate real analysis pedagogy. In today&amp;rsquo;s post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share with you some of the most interesting mathematical ideas I heard today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I am in Baltimore to attend the 2014 Joint Mathematics Meetings, the largest gathering of mathematicians in the world involving the American Mathematical Society, the Mathematics Association of America, and many other professional societies related to the mathematics profession. There will be over 2500 talks given on topics ranging from the mathematics of pop-up books (#489) to the density of Henig efficient points in locally convex topological vector spaces (#2341) to rational numbers and the common core (#903).</description>
