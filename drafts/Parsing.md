The history of the development of algorithms<sup style="font-weight:bolder" id="a1" name="a1">[1](#history)</sup> to make sense of language arguably reaches farther back in history than the very notion of computing machines and without question predates the use of such algorithms to translate programs written by human beings into machine instructions to be executed by an electronic computer processor. The very idea of it—that we can, by following an ordered, deterministic list of generic instructions, recognize and understand a piece of _language_, which utterance seems inherently _human_ rather than mathematical—invites theological introspection. 

But we will leave the fascinating details about this long history and the beautiful theory that grew from it for another time.
