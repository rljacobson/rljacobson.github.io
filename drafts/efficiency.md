Efficiency

There are many ways to slice and dice the concept of *efficiency*. The word efficiency can be simple shorthand for minimizing a particular metric, like how much RAM a program requires, or the time it takes for a program to run to completion, or latency of messages sent across a network, or power dissipation, or compiled program size, to mention some common examples. Most engineers operate under some underspecified notion of efficiency in which an attempt is made to minimize all of these common metrics at once. This goal might be logically inconsistent, and at the very least it fails to acknowledge trade-offs required by different engineering choices between two or more of these metrics that almost always exist. The prioritization of these different metrics is almost never made explicit or even consciously thought out, leaving how different engineering choices are made up to the influences of culture, subjective perception, system defaults, sheer accidents of history, and so forth.
