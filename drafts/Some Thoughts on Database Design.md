# Some Thoughts on Database Design

The design of a database schema is in practice a conversation between the developer, the dataset(s), and the problem the
db solves. (The client is often a partial proxy for the problem.) Database schemas are not created at once out of whole
cloth and then never changed. They are grown, modified, and evolved to better fit the needs of the application. A schema
can be changed in a variety of ways throughout application development. Many kinds of modifications are trivial, easy to
implement, or otherwise uninteresting. In this article, I discuss two specific kinds of schema refactoring tasks
that are common during the development process but that are in general disruptive to the codebase. The point is to
think about what is required to carry out these tasks and how the tasks might be made easier. I then discuss another
kind of refactoring of schema that occurs in parallel to the first two, namely handling the common case of the failure
of the insertion of a dataset into the database.

## Two Database Refactoring Tasks

### Task 1: Relationship Promotion

Consider the contrived example of two people having lunch together. Suppose we discover that a relationship we have between entities needs to have its own properties. We need to promote the relationship to
a first-class entity. The diagram below depicts what an *instance* of the entities would look like before and after the
refactor. (Other constraints are not considered here.)

``` mermaid
stateDiagram-v2

    Before --> After : Refactor â€” Promote relationship to entity

    state Before{
        Alice --> Bob : eats lunch with
    }

    state After{
        Alice_ --> LunchDate: participates in
        Bob_ --> LunchDate: participates in
    }
```

 The entity relationship diagram before the refactor:

``` mermaid
erDiagram
    Person ||--|| Person : "eats lunch with"
    Person {
        string name
        int number
    }
```
The entity relationship diagram after the refactor:

``` mermaid
erDiagram
    Person ||--|{ LunchDate : "participates in"
```

### Task 2: Property Promotion

Consider the `LunchDate` entity from the previous example. It might have properties like the time the people agreed to
meet, the restaurant they plan to eat at, and so forth.

```mermaid
classDiagram

    class LunchDate {
        time: DateTime
        location: String
        &vellip;
    }
```

Suppose we discover that we want to keep track of information
about different restaurants that people can eat lunch at. The `location` property of `LunchDate` needs to be promoted to
a first-class entity.


```mermaid
classDiagram

    LunchDate "*" --> "1" Restaurant

    class LunchDate {
        time: DateTime
        location: Restaurant
        &vellip;
    }

    class Restaurant {
        open_time: DateTime
        close_time: DateTime
        phone_number: String
        &vellip;
    }

```

## Model Granularity

In both refactoring tasks above, the *granularity* of the data model has become finer. The granularity of a model is the
extent to which abstraction is present in the model. In a finer (more *refined*) granularity:

* Hierarchies are expanded. Call this *vertical expansion*. E.g., a `LunchDate` is a `MealDate`, which is a `Meeting`, which is both an `Event` and an `Activity`,
  ....

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Meeting --|> Activity
    Meeting --|> Event
    MealDate --|> Meeting
    LunchDate --|> MealDate
```

* Properties are promoted to entities. Call this *horizontal expansion*.


```mermaid
classDiagram
    class LunchDate_ {
        time: DateTime
        restaurant: String
        person_a: String
        person_b: String
    }

    LunchDate "*" *-- "1" Time
    LunchDate "*" *-- "1" Restaurant
    LunchDate "1" *-- "2" Person

    LunchDate_ ..> LunchDate : is refactored to
```

In the limit, every relationship is an *is-a* relationship.


Not having enough granularity in the model results in
